# Pool Party @ Rarible

The goal of Pool Party contract is to allow any dApp that is using the Rarible Protocol to seamlessly integrate the ability for groups or individuals to come together to buy an NFT that is listed on Rarible.

Once the pool has been filled enough to afford the NFT, the item is purchased by the pool via Rarible and the NFT is then fractionalized and distributed to the pool contributors. 

This provides a few benefits to the marketplace that integrates this and its users.

* Allows a lower entry of barrier for small capital players
* Enables a simple way for groups of people to buy and share an NFT
* Increases the probability of making a sell on the NFT
* Pools opened with Pool Party also gain interest as they reach fullilment.
